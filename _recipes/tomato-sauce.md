> Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered at a very slow, but steady simmer for 45 minutes. Stir occasionally, mashing any large pieces of tomato with a spoon. Taste and correct for salt.

> Discard the onion before tossing the sauce with pasta. You can freeze the sauce, but remember to discard the onion before doing so.
