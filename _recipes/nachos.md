> Preheat the oven at 400 degrees.

---

* `1 pound` ground beef
* `½` yellow onion, diced

> Meanwhile on the stovetop, brown the ground beef and diced onions over medium-high heat until fully cooked (about 8 minutes) and drain.

---

* `2 tsp` chili powder
* `2 tsp` cumin
* `1 tsp` garlic powder
* `½ tsp` paprika
* `¼ tsp` oregano
* `1 tsp` salt
* `1 tsp` black pepper

> Return the beef to the pan, and sprinkle on the taco seasoning (see ingredient list, can be replaced with store bought taco seasoning). 

---

> Stir in ¾ cup water, bring it to a simmer, reduce heat and simmer until the liquid mostly evaporates, about 5 minutes.

---

* `2 bags` tortilla chips (`16 ounces` each)

> While the beef is cooking, add a generous layer of chips to two baking sheets lined with parchment paper.

---

* `1 can` refried beans

> Spoon on refried beans, half on each pan. These are thick, but I just add spoon fulls all over the chips. (The spoon fulls will spread with the heat of the oven.)

---

> Spoon on half the ground beef to each pan of chips.

---

* `16 ounces` shredded cheese of choice (I used cheddar and Monterey jack)

> Sprinkle shredded cheese on top. 

---

> Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.

---

* `3` roma tomatoes, diced
* `2 to 3` green onions, sliced

> Remove from the oven, and sprinkle on diced tomatoes and green onions.

---

> Serve immediately.
