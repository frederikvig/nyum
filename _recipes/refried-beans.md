* `1 tbsp` olive oil
* `½ cup` finely chopped onions
* `½ tsp` salt, to taste
* `2` gloves garlic, minced
* `½ tsp` chili powder
* `¼ tsp` ground cumin
* `2 cans` pinto or black beans (15 ounce each), rinsed and drained
* `½ cup` water
* `2 tbsp` chopped fresh cilantro
* `1 tbsp` lime juice, to taste

> In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onions and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened and are turning translucent, about 5 to 8 minutes.

---

> Add the garlic, chili powder and cumin. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained beans and water. Stir, cover and cook for 5 minutes.

---

> Reduce the heat to low and remove the lid. Use a potato masher or the back of a fork to mash up about at least half of the beans, until you reach your desired consistency. Continue to cook the beans, uncovered, stirring often, for 3 more minutes.

---

> Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the cilantro and lime juice. Taste, and add more salt and lime juice if necessary. If the beans seem dry, add a very small splash of water and stir to combine. Cover until you’re ready to serve.
