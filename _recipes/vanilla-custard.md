* `250 ml` heavy cream
* `250 ml` whole milk
* `100 g` sugar
* `1` vanilla bean (or vanilla sugar/extract)
* `35 g` corn starch
* `4` egg yolks

> Add 200 ml milk, cream and the sugar into a saucepan. Make sure there's enough space and that the pan is not more than half full.

---

> Split the vanilla bean (or use 2 tsp vanilla extract) and add the seeds with the bean into the pot.

---

> Warm it slowly to boiling point. In a separate bowl add the remaining 50 ml of milk with the corn starch and mix together. Mix in the egg yolks.

---

> Add ⅔ of the warm liquid into the bowl with the egg liquid, a little at a time. Mix thoroughly the whole time.

---

> Sift it back into the pot, and let it soft boil while constantly stirring so it doesn't burn in the bottom.

---

> Once it's started to thicken, add it to a shallow plate and cover with saran wrap (touching the custard).

---

> Store in fridge to cool down. Mix the custard before using it.
