* `360g` warm water (95-100°F)
* `2 tsp` instant yeast
* `1 tsp` sugar
* `520g` flour, white, whole wheat, or 50/50
* `1 tsp` salt

> Add all the ingredients and mix at medium for 6-8 minutes. If using a bread machine add all ingredients (start with water and end with salt on top of the flour), and select the dough setting.

---

> Cover and let it sit in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.

---

> Take the dough out of the bowl and gently deflate with your hands. Use just a tiny bit of flour to help you if it is too sticky. Split into 6 evenly sized balls, around 145g each.

---

> Let the pita bread balls rest for 15 minutes before shaping. This is the second proof and will allow your dough to relax and become easier to shape.

---

> To form the pita bread, you can either use a rolling pin, or stretch it with your hands, about 20cm in diameter. Make sure it's very thin since it will puff up in the pan later. A rolling pin will make a crunchier pita, while hand stretching a softer, fluffier one. If the dough springs back, set it aside for a few minutes to rest and then continue rolling again.

---

> Heat a non-sticking frying pan to medium heat and add just a little bit of olive oil and wipe off any excess. Bake each pita bread for about 2-3 minutes on each side, until slightly coloured and still soft. If your pan has a lid, place the lid on while baking them to keep the moisture in.

---

> To give it more color, when you flip your pita bread, push it lightly with a wooden spoon on the pan.
