title: Pasta With White Sausage Sauce
description: Pasta and sausage are a combination that usually suggests a dense, heavy tomato sauce. But it can also mean the very opposite. Sausage, used in small amounts, can contribute to a relatively light, almost delicate pasta sauce. In fact, sausage is a gift to the minimalist cook - it comes already seasoned, and its seasoning can be used to flavor whatever goes with it.

* `2 tbsp` butter
* `1 lb` italian sausages
* `1 cup` white wine or water
* `1 lb` cut pasta, like ziti, penne
* `1 cup` Parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste

> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.

---

> Put the butter in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. As it melts, crumble the sausage meat into it, making the bits quite small, ½ inch or less. When the meat has finished browning, add the liquid, and adjust the heat so that the mixture simmers gently.

---

> Cook the pasta until it is tender but not at all mushy. Reserve about ½ cup of the pasta cooking water.

---

> Drain the pasta, and dress with the sauce, adding a little of the reserved cooking liquid if necessary. Toss with salt, pepper and Parmesan, and serve.
