* `1 tbsp` extra-virgin olive oil
* `6 ounces` bacon, roughly chopped
* `3 pounds` beef brisket, trimmed of fat (chuck steak or stewing beef) cut into 2-inch chunks
* `2-3` large carrot sliced ½-inch thick
* `1` large white onion, diced
* `6` cloves garlic, minced (divided)
* `1` pinch coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
* `2 tbsp` flour
* `12` small pearl onions (optional)
* `3 cups` red wine like Merlot, Pinot Noir, or a Chianti -- for a milder sauce, use only 2 cups of wine
* `2-3 cups` beef stock or water (if using 2 cups of wine, use 3 cups beef stock or water)
* `2 tbsp` tomato paste
* `1` beef bullion cube, crushed
* `1 tsp` fresh thyme, finely chopped
* `2 tbsp` fresh parsley, finely chopped (divided)
* `2` bay leaves
* `12 ounces` fresh small white or brown mushrooms, quartered
* `2 tbsp` butter

> In a large dutch oven or heavy based pot, sauté the bacon over medium heat in 1 tablespoon of oil for about 3 minutes, until crisp and browned. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a large dish and set aside.

> Pat dry beef with paper towel; sear in batches in the hot oil/bacon fat until browned on all sides. Remove to the dish with the bacon.

---

> In the remaining oil/bacon fat, sauté the carrots and diced onions until softened, (about 3 minutes), then add 4 cloves minced garlic and cook for 1 minute. Drain excess fat and return the bacon and beef back into the pot; season with ½ teaspoon coarse salt and ¼ teaspoon ground pepper. Sprinkle with flour, toss well and cook for 4-5 minutes to brown.

---

> Add the pearl onions, wine and enough stock/water so that the meat is barely covered. Then add the tomato paste, bullion and herbs. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is falling apart.

---

> In the last 5 minutes of cooking time, prepare your mushrooms: Heat the butter in a medium-sized skillet/pan over heat. When the foam subsides, add the remaining 2 cloves garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds), then add in the mushrooms. Cook for about 5 minutes, while shaking the pan occasionally to coat with the butter. Season with salt and pepper, if desired.

> Add browned mushrooms to the pot, let simmer for an additional 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, to combine. Salt and pepper to taste.

---

> Garnish with parsley and serve with mashed potatoes, rice or egg noodles.
