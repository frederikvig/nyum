* `2¼ tsp` active dry yeast (one 1¼ ounce pack)
* `440 gram` all-purpose flour
* `345 gram` flour (antimo caputo pasta 00 flour)
* `¼ cup` extra-virgin olive oil
* `2½ cups` water
* `1⅓ tbsp` sugar
* `1 tbsp` kosher salt (or to taste)

> In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the yeast and flours. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly pour in the oil. Add the water and mix until combined. The dough will be quite wet.

---

> Knead the dough for 5 minutes with the mixer by continuing  to let it run. Sprinkle the sugar and salt on top of the dough and continue to knead vigorously for 1 minute, or until the dough comes together.

---

> Divide the dough into six equal pieces and shape each chunk into a ball. Lightly flour a baking sheet. Place the dough balls on the baking sheet. Sprinkle more flour over the top and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough sit at room temperature for 1 hour or until double in size. The dough can be used at this point, but will only improve by spending the night in the refrigerator.

* `1 (14 ounce)` can crushed tomatoes
* `1 glove` garlic, grated
* `1 tsp` kosher salt (or to taste)

> In a small bowl, combine the tomatoes, garlic, and salt. You can make this ahead and let it sit at room temperature for a day or store in fridge for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months.
