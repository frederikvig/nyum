title: Cacio e Pepe
description: This classic Roman pasta easily ranks up there as one of our family's all-time favorite comfort foods. We cook up a batch of cacio e pepe at least once or twice a month, often turning to it in a pinch because we make it a point to keep the three main ingredients — "cacio" (cheese), "pepe" (black pepper), and pasta (we usually opt for bucatini) — always stocked in our kitchen.

* `1 lb` uncooked pasta, like bucatini or spaghetti 
* `4 tbsp` butter
* `2 tsp` freshly-ground coarse black pepper
* `4 ounces` finely-grated Pecorino-Romano cheese, or parmesan in a pinch
* Kosher salt, strictly just needed if using parmesan cheese

> Boil the pasta water. Fill a large stockpot about halfway full of water and bring it to a rolling boil. Generously season the water with fine salt (about 1-2 tablespoons).

---

> Bloom the pepper. Meanwhile, as the pasta water heats, melt the butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the pepper and let it cook for 30 seconds, then turn off the heat. If you have an electric stove, you'll want to remove the pan from the hot burner entirely.

> Cook the pasta. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is just barely al dente.

---

> Toss the pasta. Use tongs to quickly transfer the pasta directly to the sauté pan with the melted butter and pepper. Add ⅔ cup of the starchy pasta water to the pan and toss the pasta briefly to combine. Add in half of the cheese and toss the pasta briefly to coat. Add in the remaining half of the cheese and continue tossing the pasta, adding in a few extra tablespoons of starchy pasta water if needed to thin out the sauce, until the cheese is melted and forms a smooth and glossy sauce.

> Serve. Serve the pasta immediately, garnished with an extra twist of black pepper and/or extra Pecorino if desired. This pasta is definitely best served hot out of the pan, so please enjoy it right away!
