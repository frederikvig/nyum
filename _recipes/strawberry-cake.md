* `3 cups` heavy whipping cream
* `8 oz` cream cheese, softened at room temperature
* `¾ cup` granulated sugar
* `1½ lb` fresh strawberries, 1 lb to blend and ½ lb for decor

> For cake layers please see [Sponge Cake recipe](/sponge-cake).

> Cut strawberries into quarters if large and place them in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until consistency of chunky applesauce; set aside.

---

> Beat cold heavy whipping cream on high speed with whisk attachment for 1-2 min until stiff and spreadable then remove to a separate dish.

---

> In the same mixing bowl (no need to wash it), beat together cream cheese and ¾ cup sugar about 2 min until smooth and lump-free, scraping down a bowl a couple times. Using a spatula, fold in whipped cream.

---

> Place the first layer cut-side-up on your serving dish and spread with ⅓ of the strawberry puree. Some good strawberry marmelade can also be added for extra taste.

---

> Spread about ½ cup frosting on the second cake layer and place it over the first layer so the strawberries and cream are hugging. Repeat with the next layers.

---

> Frost the top and sides with remaining frosting. Decorate the top with melted chocolate. I cut the little strawberries in half and placed them on each of the chocolate "vines." Then I put strawberries halves around the base of the cake. If you can't find small strawberries; raspberries would work well for the decor also as they are tiny and look cute cut in half.
