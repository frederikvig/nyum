* `¼ cup` all-purpose flour
* `¼ cup` grated Parmesan, plus more for serving
* `4` thin-cut boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 1 pound)
* `1 tbsp` olive oil
* `4 tbsp` butter, divided
* `1` medium shallot, minced
* `2` garlic cloves, minced
* `½ cup` dry white wine
* `½ cup` chicken broth
* `1 tsp` dried basil (or 1 tbsp chopped fresh basil)
* `1 tsp` dried oregano (or 1 tsp chopped fresh oregano)
* `½ cup` heavy cream
* `2 oz` cream cheese, at room temperature
* `2 cups` packed baby spinach (about 3 ounces)
* Salt and black pepper

> On a plate, mix together the flour, Parmesan, and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Dredge each chicken breast in the mixture, evenly coating on both sides.

> Heat a large skillet over medium. Add the olive oil and 2 tablespoons butter. Once the butter is melted and bubbling, add the chicken and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a plate.

---

> Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet. Add the shallot, garlic, and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes.

---

> Add wine, broth, basil and oregano, and stir, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until the liquid has reduced by about half, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the heavy cream and cream cheese and stir, allowing the cream cheese to soften and melt, until a thick sauce forms, about 6 minutes. Add baby spinach and stir until it is folded into the cream sauce and the spinach is beginning to wilt, about 1 minute.

> Return the chicken breasts to the pan and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and serve immediately with freshly grated Parmesan on top.
