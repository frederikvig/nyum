* `1½ cups` all-purpose flour
* `3½ teaspoons` baking powder
* `1 teaspoon` salt
* `1 tablespoon` white sugar
* `1½ cups` milk (sometimes more, look at tickness and how it forms when in pan)

* `3 tablespoons` butter, melted

> In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.

> Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
