title: Tomato Basil Chicken Breasts
description: This chicken takes a cue from piccata then heads in a decidedly summery direction. A quick pan sauce of butter, shallots, tomatoes, capers and a splash of red wine vinegar turns rich, juicy, and bright — just the thing to spoon over the top.

* `1 lb` boneless skinless chicken breasts, 2-3 small/medium
* `¼ cup` all-purpose flour
* `3 tbsp` unsalted butter, divided
* `1 tbsp` olive oil
* `2 tbsp` diced shallots (about 1 medium shallot) 
* `12 oz` tomatoes, small ones halved and medium and large cut in wedges
* `1-2 tbsp` capers in brine, drained 
* `½ tsp` red wine vinegar
* salt and pepper, to taste
* Plenty of basil leaves (large leaves torn), for serving

> Salt the chicken breasts the day before and leave in fridge in a plastic bag or container. Take the chicken breasts out 30 minutes before cooking and pat dry with paper towel.

---

> Season the chicken breasts all over with salt and pepper. Add the flour to a shallow bowl or plate. Dredge the chicken by placing it in the flour, then turning to coat all sides evenly.

---

> Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium. When the mixture is bubbling, shake off any excess flour from the chicken and add to the skillet. Cook, undisturbed, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Flip the pieces over and continue cooking until cooked through, about 5 more, until internal temperature reaches 160°F. Transfer the chicken to two serving plates.

---

> Add the shallots to the pan and cook, stirring, until softened and lightly caramelized, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and ⅓ cup water (this helps create more sauce and helps the tomatoes cook more quickly). Simmer until the sauce is reduced by about half, about 3 minutes.

---

> Stir in the capers, the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and the vinegar. Turn off the heat and season with salt.

---

> To serve, top the chicken with the basil leaves and the tomato sauce and season with black pepper.

---

> Serve with rice or bread.
