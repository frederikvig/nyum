* `4` pork chops, about 1-inch thick and `6 to 7 ounces` each
* Salt, to taste
* `1 tbsp` all-purpose flour
* `1 tsp` chili powder, see our homemade chili powder recipe
* `1 tsp` garlic powder
* `1 tsp` onion powder
* `½ tsp` smoked paprika
* `½ tsp` ground black pepper
* `1 tbsp` olive oil
* `1 cup` low-sodium chicken stock, see our homemade chicken stock recipe
* `1 tbsp` apple cider vinegar
* `2 tsp` honey or brown sugar
* `1 tbsp` butter
* `2 tbsp` chopped fresh parsley, optional

> Take the pork chops out of the refrigerator and season on both sides with salt and pepper — we use just less than 1/4 teaspoon of fine salt per pork chop. Set the chops aside to rest for 30 minutes.

---

> Meanwhile, make the spice rub. In a small bowl, mix the flour, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and smoked paprika. After 30 minutes, use a paper towel to pat the pork chops dry then rub both sides of the chops with the spice rub.

---

> Heat the oil in a medium skillet (with lid) over medium-high heat. As soon as the oil is hot and looks shimmery, add the pork. Cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.

---

> Flip the pork so that the seared side is facing up. (If there is a fattier side of the pork, use kitchen tongs to hold the chops, fat-side-down until it sizzles and browns slightly; about 30 seconds.) Reduce the heat to low then cover the skillet with a lid. Cook 6 to 12 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reads 145 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the chop. (Since cook time depends on the thickness of the chops, check for doneness at 5 minutes then go from there, checking every 2 minutes). If you do not have a thermometer, you will know they are done, if when cutting into the chops, the juices run clear.

---

> Transfer pork chops to a plate then cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let the pork rest for 5 minutes.

---

> While the pork rests, make the pan sauce. Increase the heat to medium-high then add the chicken stock, vinegar, and honey. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the pan so that any stuck bits of pork come up. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half. Taste then adjust the seasoning with salt, more vinegar or honey. Slide the skillet off of the heat and when the sauce is no longer simmering, swirl in the butter. Slide the pork chops back into the pan and spoon some of the sauce on top. Alternatively, slice the chops then place back into the pan. Scatter fresh parsley over the pork then serve.
