* `½ cup` warm water (95° to 110°F)
* `2¼ tsp` active dry yeast (1 pack)
* `⅓ cup` plus 2 teaspoons sugar
* `1½ cups` whole milk
* `6 cups` all-purpose flour or bread flour
* `1½ tsp` kosher salt
* `2` large eggs
* `8 tbsp` unsalted butter, 1 stick at room temperature
* Cooking spray
* `4 tbsp` unsalted butter, ½ stick melted
* `2 tsp` Maldon salt or other flaky salt (optional)


> In a small bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and 2 teaspoons of the sugar. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.

---

> In a small saucepan, warm the milk to between 100° and 110°F.

---

> In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine 6 cups of the flour, the remaining 1⁄3 cup sugar, and the kosher salt. Give it a quick stir to mix the ingredients.

---

> Turn the mixer on low and slowly add the yeast mixture, warmed milk and eggs. Mix for 5 to 10 minutes. Add the softened butter and mix for 5 more minutes. The dough should be slightly sticky but able to pull away from the sides of the bowl. If the dough sticks to the bowl, add flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it reaches the desired texture.

---

> Transfer the dough to a medium bowl lightly sprayed with cooking spray and cover with plastic wrap. Set in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1-1½ hours.

---

> Remove the plastic wrap and lightly punch down the dough to release the air.

---

> Using a kitchen scale, divide and weigh the dough into 32 pieces (about 11⁄2 ounces each). Gently roll the dough pieces into balls and place them touching on a sheet pan.

---

> Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour, or until soft and pillowy. They should bounce back a bit if lightly touched.

---

> While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 375°F.

---

> Remove the plastic wrap, transfer the rolls to the oven, and bake until deep golden brown, about 25 minutes.

---

> When the rolls come out of the oven, immediately brush them with the melted butter and sprinkle with the Maldon salt (if using). Serve warm.

---

> Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.
