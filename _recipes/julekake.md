* `900 g` all-purpose flour
* `150 g` white sugar
* `500 ml` whole milk
* `2¼ tsp` instant or active dry yeast
* `2 tsp` cardemom
* `1 tsp` salt
* `1` egg
* `1 tsp` vanilla extract
* `175 g` butter at room temperature in cubes
* `250 g` raisins
* `1` egg for brushing

> Place everything except the butter, second egg and raisins in a stand mixer with the dough hook on low (speed 2 on KitchenAid) for 5-10 minutes.

---

> Add the cubes of butter and let it run for another 10 minutes.

---

> Add the raisins to the dough until they're incorporated (but not too long).

---

> Set aside and cover with some plastic and a kitchen towel for 2 hours to rise until double in size.

---

> Cut into 3 equally large pieces and shape each into a round or oval bread. Put on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.

---

> Cover and let rise for another 2 hours, until double in size.

---

> Brush with beaten egg.

---

> Preheat the oven to 200 celsius (400 fahrenheit) and bake for 30 minutes. Around the 20 minute mark take a look and if it browns too quickly on top, cover it with some foil. Bake until the internal temperature reaches 206°F-210°F.

---

> Let them cool. Slice and enjoy either plain or with butter.
