* `150 g (5 oz)` dried tagliatelle
* `3` sausages
* `½ (15g)` a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley 
* `1` large egg (2 medium)
* `30 g (1 oz)` Parmesan cheese
* salt and pepper to taste

> Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water.

---

> Meanwhile, squeeze the sausagemeat out of the skins, then, with wet hands, quickly shape into 18 even-sized balls.

---

> Roll and coat them in black pepper, then cook in a non- stick frying pan on a medium heat with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil until golden and cooked through, tossing regularly, then turn the heat off.

---

> Finely chop the parsley, stalks and all, beat it with the egg and a splash of pasta cooking water, then finely grate and mix in most of the Parmesan.

---

> Toss the drained pasta into the sausage pan, pour in the egg mixture, and toss for 1 minute off the heat (the egg will gently cook in the residual heat).

---

> Loosen with a good splash of reserved cooking water, season to perfection with sea salt and pepper, and finely grate over the remaining Parmesan.
