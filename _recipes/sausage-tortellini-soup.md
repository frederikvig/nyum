* `1 lb` raw mild Italian sausage, casings removed
* `1` medium yellow onion, diced (about 1 1/2 cups)
* `3` cloves garlic, minced
* `2 tsp`  kosher salt
* `¼ tsp` freshly ground black pepper
* `¼ tsp` red pepper flakes (optional)
* `¼ tsp` dryed oregano (optional)
* `2 tbsp` all-purpose flour
* `32 oz` low-sodium chicken broth (about 4 cups)
* `8-9 oz` cheese tortellini (about 2 1/2 cups)
* `5 oz` baby spinach (about 5 packed cups)
* `1 cup` half-and-half


> Cook 1 pound raw Italian sausage in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, then add the diced onion and cook until soft and the meat is no longer pink, 6 to 8 minutes.

---

> Stir in the minced garlic, the kosher salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes and oregano if using. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the flavors combine, about 1 minute. Sprinkle the flour over the sausage mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute to cook the floury taste out.

---

> Stir in 1 (32-ounce) carton low-sodium chicken broth, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to release any stuck-on bits. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a lively simmer.

---

> Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 5 minutes to let the flavors meld.

---

> Stir in cheese tortellini and baby spinach. Cook for 1 minute less than the package instructions for the tortellini. Stir in 1 cup half-and-half. Taste and season with more kosher salt and black pepper as needed.

> Enjoy!
