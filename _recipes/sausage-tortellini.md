* `1 lb` raw mild Italian sausage, casings removed
* `1` medium yellow onion, diced (about 1 1/2 cups)
* `3` cloves garlic, minced
* `½ cup` chicken broth
* `2 tsp`  kosher salt
* `¼ tsp` freshly ground black pepper
* `¼ tsp` red pepper flakes (optional)
* `¼ tsp` dryed oregano (optional)
* `2 cans (14 oz)` diced tomatoes with juices
* `16 oz` cheese tortellini
* `5 oz` baby spinach (about 5 packed cups)
* `1 cup` heavy cream or half-and-half
* Freshly grated parmesan cheese


> Cook 1 pound raw Italian sausage in a skillet over medium heat, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, then add the diced onion and cook until soft and the meat is no longer pink, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain most of the excess fat.

---

> Stir in the minced garlic, the kosher salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes and oregano if using. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the flavors combine, about 1 minute. 

---

> Stir in the chicken broth and diced tomatoes, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to release any stuck-on bits.

---

> Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 5-7 minutes to let the flavors meld.

---

> Stir in cheese tortellini and baby spinach. Cook for 1 minute less than the package instructions for the tortellini. Stir in 1 cup heavy cream/half-and-half. Taste and season with more kosher salt and black pepper as needed.

---

> Serve with parmesan sprinkled over top. Enjoy!
