* `2 lb` ground beef
* `2 tbsp` olive oil
* `1 medium` yellow onion diced
* `6` garlic cloves finely chopped
* `½` bell pepper diced
* `1 tbsp` ground cumin
* `3 small` potatoes peeled and cut in small pieces
* `¾ cup` dry white wine
* `½ cup` whole green olives stuffed w/ pimentos
* `½ cup` raisins
* `¼ cup` capers drained
* `16 oz` of tomato sauce 2x 8 oz cans
* `1` lemon
* Salt and pepper to taste

> In a medium-size frying pan, brown the ground beef with a dash of cumin and pepper, drain off any excess grease, and set aside. Put the potato pieces in hot (from tap) water, set aside.

---

> In a large frying pan, heat 2 tbs of olive oil over med-low heat and cook the diced onion until soft.

---

> Add the chopped garlic and cook until almost golden.

---

> Mix in the bell pepper, cumin, pepper and a little salt – not too much as the olives and capers are salty.

---

> Add the potatoes pieces and cook for about 5 minutes.

---

> Add the ground beef and the wine, let the liquid reduce.

---

> Add raisins and tomato sauce when the potatoes are about half-cooked (a knife can easily through the first part but the center is still very firm).

---

> Cook for 5 more minutes and then add the olives and capers.

---

> Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are ready. If the sauce thickens too much, you can add some more wine or a little bit of water. Taste and adjust any seasonings: salt, pepper, cumin or additional olives/capers.

---

> Serve with rice, fried ripe plantains and a small salad.
