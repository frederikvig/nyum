* `2 lb` ground beef
* `2 tbsp` olive oil
* `1 large` yellow onion, diced
* `6` garlic cloves, finely chopped
* `1` bell pepper, diced
* `2 tbsp` ground cumin
* `3 medium` potatoes, peeled and cut into small pieces
* `2 cups` dry white wine
* `1-2 cups` whole green olives stuffed w/ pimentos
* `½ cup` raisins
* `¼ cup` capers, drained
* `30 oz (2x15oz cans)` tomato sauce
* `1` lemon
* Salt and pepper to taste

> Heat some water in a pot, add salt and the potatoes, let simmer for 10 minutes.

--- 

> In a large skillet, brown the ground beef with a dash of cumin and pepper, drain off any excess grease and set aside. 

---

> Add 2 tbsp of olive oil over medium-low heat and cook the diced onion until soft, about 4-5 minutes.

---

> Add the chopped garlic and cook until almost golden.

---

> Mix in the bell pepper, cumin, 1 tsp freshly grounded pepper and a little salt – not too much as the olives and capers are salty.

---

> Add the potato pieces and cook for about 5 minutes.

---

> Add back the ground beef, add the wine, and let the liquid reduce.

---

> Add raisins and the tomato sauce when the potatoes are about half-cooked (a knife can easily through the first part but the center is still very firm).

---

> Cook for 10 more minutes and then add the olives and capers.

---

> Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are ready. If the sauce thickens too much, you can add some more wine or a little bit of water. Add the lemon juice. Taste and adjust any seasonings: salt, pepper, cumin or additional olives/capers.

---

> Serve with rice, fried ripe plantains and a salad.
