> Heat the oven to 400 F degrees.

---

* `4-6` cod fillets - about 6 ounces each
* `5 tbsp` fresh lemon juice
* `5 tbsp` olive oil
* `2 tbsp` melted butter
* `5` garlic cloves, minced

* `⅓` cup all-purpose flour
* `1 tsp` ground coriander
* `¾ tsp` sweet spanish paprika
* `¾ tsp` ground cumin
* `¾ tsp` salt
* `½ tsp` black pepper

* parsley for garnish

> Mix together the lemon juice, olive oil, and melted butter in a shallow bowl (do not add the garlic yet). Set aside.

---

> In another shallow bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, spices, salt and pepper. Set next to the lemon sauce.

---

> Pat the fish dry. Dip the fish in the lemon sauce then dip it in the flour mixture. Shake off excess flour. Reserve the lemon sauce for later.

---

> Heat 2 tablespoon olive oil in a cast iron skillet (or an oven-safe pan) over medium-high heat (watch the oil to be sure it is shimmering but not smoking). Add the fish and sear on each side to give it some color, but do not fully cook (about 2 minutes on each side). Remove the skillet from heat.

---

> To the remaining lemon sauce, add the minced garlic and mix. Drizzle all over the fish fillets.

---

> Bake in the heated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork (10 minutes should do it, but begin checking earlier). Remove from the heat and sprinkle chopped parsley. Serve immediately.
