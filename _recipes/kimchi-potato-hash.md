title: Kimchi and Potato Hash
original_title: Kimchi and Potato Hash With Eggs
description: Kimchi is punchy and potatoes are mellow, but together, they play off one another like the characters in an opposites-attract love story. Though universally adored for their comforting, creamy texture, potatoes often feel stodgy as the main ingredient of a meal, but pairing them with tangy, spicy kimchi lightens them up. Cut your potatoes into small cubes to ensure they don’t take too long to cook. Hash just does not feel complete without eggs, which make this a handy one-pan meal. Finishing the dish with a drizzle of mayonnaise (preferably Kewpie, but other brands are fine, too) and a sprinkle of furikake lends a playful edge, or you can make it even more fun to eat by wrapping up piles of the hash in nori, which adds a nice crunch and will remind you of a sushi roll.

* `5 tblsp` extra-virgin olive oil
* `1` red onion, thinly sliced
* `4` garlic cloves, finely chopped
* `1 cup` kimchi, undrained and roughly chopped
* `2 pounds` pounds Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
* `4` large eggs
* Mayonnaise, for garnish
* `1` scallion, finely chopped
* Sausages cut into pieces (optional)

> Start by putting the cut potatoes in hot water for 10 minutes to soften them.

---

> Heat a large skillet over medium-high. When hot, add 2 tablespoons oil and the onion. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring every minute or so, until softened.

---

> Add the garlic, kimchi, potatoes and another 2 tablespoons oil, and toss to combine. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and cook for 5 minutes. Lift the lid, stir, cover and cook for another 6 to 8 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.

---

> Remove the lid, stir the potatoes, then make 4 divots without reaching the bottom of the pan. Drizzle a little of the remaining oil into each divot and crack an egg into each. Cover and cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until eggs are just set. If adding sausages use separate pan, start with sausages and then eggs after. Transfer to skillet.
