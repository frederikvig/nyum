title: Chicken with lemon
original_title: Chicken Breasts With Lemon
description: In this recipe, which Pierre Franey brought to The Times in 1992 in one of his 60-Minute Gourmet columns, two teaspoons of lemon zest are added to a simple sauce of lemon juice, thyme, garlic and shallots. It is, at once, lively and elegant. To round it out, it needs a sturdy accompaniment. Mr. Franey suggested mashed potatoes with garlic and basil, with just a little olive oil swirled in.

* `½ cup` flour for dredging
* Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
* `4` skinless boneless chicken breasts, about 6 ounces each
* `2 tbsp` olive oil
* `4` sprigs fresh thyme (1 tsp dried)
* `2 tbsp` finely chopped shallots
* `2 tsp` finely chopped garlic
* `2 tsp` grated lemon zest
* `3 tbsp` lemon juice
* `½ cup` chicken broth
* `2 tbsp` butter

> Season flour with salt and pepper, and dredge the chicken all over. Remove the excess flour.

> Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large enough to hold the chicken pieces in one layer. Add chicken and cook, uncovered, over medium heat for 5 minutes (longer for larger pieces) or until lightly browned.

---

> Flip the chicken and cook for 5 minutes more, or until cooked through. Carefully remove the oil from the skillet, leaving the chicken. Discard the oil.

---

> Add the thyme, shallots and garlic, and cook for about a minute. Do not burn the garlic. Add the lemon rind, the lemon juice and the broth.

---

> Scrape the skillet to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the bottom. Add the butter, and cook for 3 minutes longer. Serve immediately.
