> Rub together (using finger tips or a pastry cutter) the flour, baking powder, caster sugar, salt and butter until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs, then add the egg and buttermilk and mix gently, fondling with your fingertips to form a sticky dough.

---

> Cut the peaches into quarters, arrange the pieces in the base of a large shallow pie dish and sprinkle with the lemon juice and sugar.

---

> Roll walnut-sized balls of dough in lightly floured hands, pressing the fruit, leaving little gaps in between to allow rich rivulets of juice.

> Brush the cobbles with beaten egg, sprinkle with demerara (or light brown) sugar and bake for 45 minutes.
