* `6` large russet or gold potatoes (about 3 ½ pounds total), scrubbed
* `½ cup` milk
* Kosher salt
* `½ pound (2 sticks)` salted and unsalted (50/50) butter
* `1 tsp` freshly ground black pepper

> Peel the potatoes, leaving a little skin on each one for texture, if desired (I like to leave about 5 stripes of skin on each potato). Cut the potatoes into 1 ½-inch chunks.

---

> Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a rolling boil. Add the potatoes and simmer until they are very soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain thoroughly and return the potatoes to the pot.

---

> Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, heat the butter and milk over medium-low heat just until the butter is melted and the milk is warm.

---

> Mash the potatoes using a potato masher, adding the milk/butter mixture in about four parts, mashing as you go, until the potatoes are creamy and well blended but still have a bit of texture.

---

> Mash in 1 teaspoon salt and the pepper. Serve hot.

---

> Store leftovers in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
