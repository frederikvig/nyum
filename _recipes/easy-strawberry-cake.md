* `2` large eggs room temperature
* `1 cup` sugar
* `1 cup` sour cream
* `½ cup` vegetable oil
* `1 tsp` vanilla extract
* `2 cups` all-purpose flour (250 grams)
* `2 tsp` baking powder
* `½ tsp` salt
* `12 oz` strawberries hulled
* `1 tsp` powdered sugar, for dusting (optional)

> Butter a 9" springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Preheat oven to 375˚F. Prepare 12 oz of strawberries for the cake: dice 6 oz of strawberries and slice the second 6 oz into halves.

> In a large mixing bowl, using an electric hand mixer (or stand mixer), beat together 2 eggs with 1 cup sugar on high speed for 5 minutes or until light in color and thick.

---

> Add 1 cup sour cream, ½ cup oil, 1 tsp vanilla and beat on low speed until well combined.

> In a small bowl, whisk together: 2 cups flour, 2 tsp baking powder and ½ tsp salt until well incorporated. With the mixer on med/low speed, add flour mixture to the batter 1/3 at a time, letting the flour incorporate with each addition and continue mixing just until well combined. Do not over-mix.

> Pour half of the batter into prepared pan. Top with 6 oz of diced strawberries then spread remaining batter over the top. Cover the surface with 6 oz of halved strawberries (cut-side-down), pressing them down just slightly into the batter. Bake at 375˚F for 45-55 minutes (mine was perfect at 50 min), or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Let cake rest in pan 15-20 min before removing the ring.
