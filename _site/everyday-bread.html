                                        <p>This whole wheat sandwich
bread has all the heartiness of whole wheat flour but without any
density or bitterness. It’s tender and yielding, flavorful and
versatile; slice it up for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches or grilled
cheese, or simply smear a piece with butter.</p>

            <p>Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it
            into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fit with the
            dough hook, combine the flours, salt, and yeast. Add the
            honey, butter, and milk, mixing until no dry patches of
            flour remain and a soft dough forms. If mixing by hand,
            cover and rest for 15 minutes. If using a mixer, proceed to
            the next step.</p>

            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead
            until a tacky, springy dough forms, or mix on medium speed
            until smooth, elastic, and pulling away from the sides of
            the bowl, 5 to 8 minutes for either method.</p>

            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Return the dough to the bowl, cover, and let it rise
            until puffy but not necessarily doubled in volume, 2
            hours.</p>

            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Use a bowl scraper to gently ease the dough out of the
            bowl onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently deflate the
            dough and pat it into an 8” x 12” rectangle. Shape the dough
            into a log by bringing the short edges toward the center,
            overlapping them slightly. Flatten the dough into an even
            layer, then starting from the top, gently roll the dough
            towards you to form a log and pinch the seam to seal.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Grease an 8 1/2” x 4 1/2” loaf pan. Spread the wheat germ
            on a rimmed baking sheet in an even layer the length of the
            dough log. Wet a clean kitchen towel, then wring it out; it
            should still be pretty damp. Roll the shaped dough over the
            towel to moisten the loaf, then into the wheat germ, turning
            to coat. Place the dough seam-side down in the prepared pan.
            Cover and let rise until the loaf crowns about 1” over the
            edge of the pan, 2 hours.</p>

            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to
            350°F.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Bake the loaf for 35 minutes, or until the top is golden
            brown and the internal temperature is at least 190°F. If the
            loaf is browning too quickly, tent it loosely with foil and
            continue baking. Remove the loaf from the oven then turn it
            out of the pan and onto a rack to cool completely before
            slicing.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Store airtight at room temperature for several days;
            freeze, sliced, for longer storage.</p>
