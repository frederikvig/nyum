                                        <p>Poaching boneless, skinless
fish fillets in a brothy sauce is a foolproof (and undeniably delicious)
method for cooking fish.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Heat ¼ cup olive oil in a large skillet (use one with a
            lid) over medium-high. Add garlic and shallots and cook,
            swirling the skillet constantly until they start to toast
            and turn light golden brown, 2 minutes or so. Add red-pepper
            flakes and swirl to toast for a few seconds. Remove from
            heat and transfer all but 1 tablespoon of the chile oil to a
            small bowl.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Add tomatoes to the skillet and season with salt and
            pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until they burst and
            start to become saucy and jammy, 5 to 8 minutes. Add fish
            sauce, if using, and 1½ cups water, swirling to release any
            of the bits stuck on the bottom of the skillet.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Cook until the sauce is slightly thickened but still nice
            and brothy, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Season the fish with salt and pepper and gently lay the
            pieces in the brothy tomatoes. Cover the skillet and cook
            until the fish is opaque and just cooked through, 4 to 6
            minutes (slightly longer for a thicker piece of fish, like
            halibut).</p>

            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>To serve, transfer fish and brothy tomatoes to a large
            shallow bowl or divide among four bowls. Drizzle with
            reserved chile oil, more olive oil and the crispy shallots
            and garlic. Top with cilantro and mint, and serve with limes
            for squeezing over the top. Serve with rice, tortillas, or
            bread/toast, if you like.</p>
