            <li><code>3 tbsp</code> extra-virgin olive oil divided</li>
            <li><code>1½ pounds</code> golden yellow potatoes Yukon Gold
            or similar, about 4</li>
            <li><code>1 tsp</code> kosher salt plus additional to
            taste</li>
            <li><code>1 tsp</code> garlic powder</li>
            <li><code>½ tsp</code> dill weed</li>
            <li><code>¼ tsp</code> onion powder</li>
            <li><code>¼ tsp</code> ground black pepper</li>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Place a rack in the lower third of your oven and preheat
            to 450 degrees F. Drizzle a large rimmed baking sheet with
            1½ tablespoons olive oil, brushing it as needed so that it
            nicely coats the pan.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Scrub the potatoes and peel if desired (I leave the peels
            on). Slice into ¼-inch-wide sticks. Place the potatoes in a
            large bowl, then pour very hot tap water over the top so
            that it covers the potatoes by at least 1 inch. Let sit 10
            minutes.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Drain the potatoes, then transfer them to a clean towel
            and dry as completely as you can, changing the towel as
            needed. Rinse and wipe out the bowl you soaked the potatoes
            in, then return the potatoes to the bowl. Drizzle with the
            remaining 1½ tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with salt,
            garlic powder, dill weed, onion powder, and pepper. Toss to
            coat, making sure the spices and oil are well distributed.
            Spread the potatoes into a single layer on the prepared
            baking sheet.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Roast in the lower third of the oven for 15 to 20
            minutes, until turning golden underneath. Remove the baking
            sheet from the oven and, with a large, firm spatula,
            carefully loosen the fries from the bottom of the pan. Flip
            them in large sections as best as you can so that the
            potatoes rotate and brown evenly on all sides (no need to
            painstakingly flip every single one). With your fingers (be
            careful—the pan is hot!) return the potatoes to a single
            layer. Place the pan back in the oven and continue baking
            until the fries are as golden and crisp as you like, about 5
            to 10 additional minutes (30 minutes total was ideal timing
            for this crispy-fry lover). While the fries are hot,
            sprinkle with any desired toppings and a bit more salt to
            taste. DEVOUR.</p>
