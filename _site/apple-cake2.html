                                        <p>Greenspan is emphatic that
you choose four different kinds of apple, since they each behave
differently when baked. Some sweeten and collapse; some stay structural
and tart. They do all the work of making the cake interesting, without a
crumble, or nuts, or even cinnamon.</p>

            <p>Center a rack in the oven, and preheat the oven to 350°F
            (175°C). Generously butter an 8-inch (20cm) springform pan
            and put it on a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking
            mat or parchment paper.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in
            small bowl.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>In a bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk until they’re
            foamy. Pour in the sugar and whisk for a minute or so to
            blend. Whisk in the rum and vanilla. Whisk in half the flour
            mixture and when it is incorporated, add half the melted
            butter, followed by the rest of the flour mixture and the
            remaining butter, mixing gently after each addition so that
            you have a smooth, rather thick batter. Switch to a rubber
            spatula and fold in the apples, turning the fruit so that
            it’s coated with batter. Scrape the mix into the pan and
            poke it around a little with the spatula so that it’s
            evenish.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Slide the pan into the oven and bake for 60 minutes,
            until the top of the cake is golden brown and a knife
            inserted deep into the center comes out clean; the cake may
            pull away from the sides of the pan. Transfer to a cooling
            rack and let rest for 5 minutes.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Carefully run a blunt knife around the edges of the cake
            and remove the sides of the springform pan. (Open the
            springform slowly, and before it’s fully opened, make sure
            there aren’t any apples stuck to it.) Allow the cake to cool
            until it is just slightly warm or at room temperature. If
            you want to remove the cake from the bottom of the
            springform pan, wait until the cake is almost cooled, then
            run a long spatula between the cake and the pan, cover the
            top of the cake with a piece of parchment or waxed paper,
            and invert it onto a rack. Carefully remove the bottom of
            the pan and turn the cake over onto a serving dish.</p>

            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>The cake can be served warm or at room temperature, and
            will keep for about 2 days at room temperature. Greenspan’s
            husband says it gets more comforting with each passing day.
            However long you keep the cake, it’s best not to cover it -
            it’s too moist. Leave the cake on its plate and just press a
            piece of plastic wrap or wax paper against the cut
            surfaces.</p>
