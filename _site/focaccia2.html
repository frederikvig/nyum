            <li><code>3 cups (360g)</code> all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><code>1½ tsp (9g)</code> salt</li>
            <li><code>1 tsp (5g)</code> sugar</li>
            <li><code>1 tsp (3g)</code> instant yeast</li>
            <li><code>1¼ cups (284g)</code> water, warm (90-110°F)</li>
            <li><code>1½ tbsp (19.5g)</code> olive oil</li>

            <blockquote>
            <p>To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by
            gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.
            In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, sugar, and
            yeast.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Add the water and olive oil and stir — with a spatula,
            bowl scraper, dough whisk, or your hands — until the mixture
            is thoroughly combined and homogeneous; there should be no
            dry patches or lumps. Cover the bowl and set it aside for 15
            minutes.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Perform the first bowl fold: Use a wet hand to grab a
            section of dough from one side of the bowl, then lift it up
            and press it into the center. Repeat this motion, grabbing a
            new section of dough each time, until you’ve made a full
            circle around the bowl, about 8 to 12 times. Once you’ve
            circled the bowl, flip the dough over in the bowl so that
            the smooth side is up; the first bowl fold is now complete.
            Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Repeat the bowl fold for a second time. (Remember to use
            a wet hand to prevent the dough from sticking!) At this
            point, the dough should feel smoother and tighter. Cover the
            bowl and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Repeat the bowl fold for a third time. Cover the bowl and
            let the dough rest for 15 minutes.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Repeat the bowl fold for a fourth and final time; the
            dough should feel relatively strong.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Cover the bowl and let the dough rise at a warm room
            temperature (70°F to 75°F) for 1 hour. After 1 hour, the
            dough should have nearly doubled in size and will be very
            puffy; it may even have a few bubbles on the surface.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>To prepare the pan: Once the dough has risen, spray the
            bottom and sides of a 9” square Focaccia Pan with nonstick
            spray. You can also use a 10” cast-iron skillet. Then add 1
            tablespoon (13g) of the olive oil and tilt the pan to spread
            the oil evenly across the bottom.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Use a bowl scraper or flexible spatula to gently transfer
            the risen dough to the center of the pan. Using your hand as
            paddles (and a bowl scraper for assistance, if you need it)
            swiftly but gently flip the dough over so that it’s coated
            in oil; try to handle the dough minimally to keep it from
            deflating.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Cover the pan and let the dough rise at a warm room
            temperature for 1 to 1½ hours, until it’s marshmallowy and
            jiggly; the dough should nearly fill the corners of the pan
            and be very close to the top edge.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Toward the end of the rise, preheat the oven to 475°F
            with racks in the upper and lower thirds.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <ul>
            <li><code>2 tbsp (26g)</code> olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>flaky sea salt</li>
            <li>rosemary (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Once the dough has risen, lightly coat your fingers in
            oil. Starting at one edge, press your fingertips into the
            dough until they reach the bottom of the pan, creating
            dimples. Repeat this process, working your way from one edge
            to the other, spacing the dimples about 1½” apart. The goal
            is to thoroughly dimple the dough without deflating it — aim
            for decisive yet gentle motions. If there are any large
            untouched areas of the dough, add additional dimples using
            one finger.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>To top the dough: Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon
            (13g) olive oil all over the surface of the dough; it’s OK
            if it pools in some dimples. Sprinkle evenly with flaky salt
            (use ½ teaspoon Maldon).</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Bake the focaccia on the lower rack for 15 to 18 minutes,
            until brown in the highest spots and golden in the crevices.
            If necessary, move the pan to the top rack and broil briefly
            for the final 1 to 2 minutes, watching carefully, to achieve
            the desired color.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Remove the focaccia from the oven. Slide the focaccia out
            of the pan and transfer it to a wire rack or cutting board.
            Turn off the oven and slide the focaccia back into the oven,
            directly on the lower rack, for 5 to 7 minutes, until the
            sides are golden brown and crisp. Remove the focaccia from
            the oven once again and transfer it to a wire rack to cool
            completely.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Storage information: Focaccia is best enjoyed the day
            it’s made. If storing leftovers, wrap the focaccia loosely
            in foil, keep it at room temperature, and reheat before
            serving.</p>
