,{"description":"In a modern world of Cinnamon Hot Pockets and Pecan Pie Pringles, apple-picking is one of the few agricultural rituals we can all still get our hands into. This cake — a classic from 1973 — is a godsend to anyone who has overloaded at the pick-your-own orchard or overbought at the farmers’ market. Like many simple cakes, this one uses neutral oil that lets the fruit flavor come through, rather than show-offy butter.","favorite":"✓","htmlfile":"apple-cake.html","image":"images/apple-cake.jpg","original_title":"Teddie’s Apple Cake","size":"8 servings","source":"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/7474-teddies-apple-cake","sweet":"✓","time":"1 hours 30 minutes","title":"Apple Cake","vegan":"✓"}

,{"description":"This recipe uses four bananas, which is more than is typical for a single loaf. The natural sugars from the ripe, brown bananas keep the bread incredibly moist for up to one week, even sliced. The high moisture of the batter can make it tricky to determine doneness, so take care not to underbake the the loaf. It should have a dry, shiny, cracked surface, and a tester inserted into the thickest portion should come out with a few moist crumbs attached. Serve this banana bread for breakfast or brunch, or even as a simple dessert, topped with a scoop of coffee ice cream.","favorite":"✓","htmlfile":"banana-bread.html","image":"images/banana-bread.jpg","original_title":"Chocolate-Chip Banana Bread","size":"8 servings","source":"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020899-chocolate-chip-banana-bread","sweet":"✓","time":"1 hours 30 minutes","title":"Banana Bread","vegan":"✓"}

,{"description":"Kimchi is punchy and potatoes are mellow, but together, they play off one another like the characters in an opposites-attract love story. Though universally adored for their comforting, creamy texture, potatoes often feel stodgy as the main ingredient of a meal, but pairing them with tangy, spicy kimchi lightens them up. Cut your potatoes into small cubes to ensure they don’t take too long to cook. Hash just does not feel complete without eggs, which make this a handy one-pan meal. Finishing the dish with a drizzle of mayonnaise (preferably Kewpie, but other brands are fine, too) and a sprinkle of furikake lends a playful edge, or you can make it even more fun to eat by wrapping up piles of the hash in nori, which adds a nice crunch and will remind you of a sushi roll.","favorite":"✓","htmlfile":"kimchi-potato-hash.html","image":"images/kimchi-potato-hash.jpg","original_title":"Kimchi and Potato Hash With Eggs","size":"4 servings","source":"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022152-kimchi-and-potato-hash-with-eggs?action=click&amp;module=RecipeBox&amp;pgType=recipebox-page&amp;region=all&amp;rank=20","time":"30 minutes","title":"Kimchi and Potato Hash","vegan":"✓"}
