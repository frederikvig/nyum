            <blockquote>
            <p>In a large mixing bowl or your kitchen aid mixer add the
            flour, salt and yeast. Use a spatula or the paddle
            attachment and mix to combine well.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Pour in the warm water and keep mixing until everything
            is incorporated and a soft dough has formed. It will still
            stick to the bottom of the bowl and that is OK.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Cover the bowl with some plastic wrap loosely and a tea
            towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 2 to
            3 hours until doubled in size.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Sprinkle some flour on your kitchen counter and dump the
            bread dough on it. Flour your hands to help it out of the
            bowl as it will be sticky. Don’t panic, this is normal.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>With floured hands fold the dough onto itself forming it
            into a round ball. Do not knead it, do not handle it anymore
            than you need to. Use a sharp knife and lightly carve an X
            in the top of the loaf or just make a few cuts across.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Place the bread dough on top of a lightly floured pizza
            peel, cardboard or parchment paper and allow it to rest
            while your oven is heating up.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Preheat your oven to 450”F with a pizza stone inside for
            about 45 minutes before baking the bread. Fill an oven proof
            bowl with ice cubes or cold water and place it on the bottom
            rack. This will create the steam that will cause the crust
            to become crispy as it bakes.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Once your oven is hot sprinkle the pizza stone with some
            semolina flour or corn meal and carefully slide the bread
            loaf on top. Bake the bread for about 30 to 45 minutes until
            golden brown all over and cooked through.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
            <p>Transfer the bread to a cooling rack and allow to cool
            off completely before slicing into it. You can also let it
            cool inside the oven with the door slightly open.</p>
